# ☕ **Starbucks Operational Process & Capacity Analysis Project**
### Improving Workflow Efficiency, Reducing Bottlenecks & Enhancing Customer Experience
</div>

---

## 📌 **Project Overview**
This project provides a full operational assessment of **Starbucks' in-store and mobile ordering workflow**, focusing on queue behavior, staffing capacity, service times, and supply chain constraints. Using capacity modeling, process mapping, and scenario simulation, this analysis uncovers inefficiencies and proposes actionable, data-driven improvements.

The goal: **Increase throughput, reduce wait times, and optimize the customer experience.**

---

## 🎯 **Key Objectives**
- Identify bottlenecks across in-store and mobile workflows  
- Analyze customer demand vs. worker processing capacity  
- Model queue performance and instability under peak load  
- Design improved operational flows to increase throughput  
- Evaluate supply chain limitations affecting performance  

---

## 📊 **Key Findings**

### 🟩 **1. Demand Exceeded Worker Capacity**
- Customer demand: **30 customers/hr**  
- Worker capacity: **26 customers/hr**  
- Result → Persistent queue buildup & decreased service speed  

---

### 🟩 **2. Mobile Orders Created Queue Instability**
- Mobile ordering acted as a **second demand stream**  
- Increased total workload → **10+ minute wait times**  
- Staff struggled to manage parallel order flows  

---

### 🟩 **3. Process Mapping Revealed System Imbalance**
Developed detailed diagrams for:
- In-store workflow  
- Mobile-order workflow  

Findings:
- Processing speeds across workers were mismatched  
- Caused unstable queues & inconsistent service times  

---

### 🟩 **4. Redesign Improved Capacity to Meet Demand**
Modeled operational improvements:
- Worker 1 improved from **60 sec → higher throughput**  
- Worker 2 improved from **120 sec → more balanced flow**  
- Total system capacity increased to **30 customers/hr**  
- Result → System meets demand without instability  

---

### 🟩 **5. Supply Chain Issues Impacted Store Efficiency**
Identified issues:
- Transportation delays  
- Understaffing at peak times  
- Inaccurate demand forecasting  
- Over-reliance on outsourcing  

Recommended solutions:
- Reduce outsourcing  
- Improve internal logistics  
- Use loyalty-app analytics for demand prediction
